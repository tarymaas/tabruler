# tabruler README

TabRuler allows users to jump to the next vertical ruler in VSCode by hitting the space key twice in quick succession.

## Features

Find the next ruler on double tap, and insert as many spaces as required to reach the ruler. If no ruler is found, 2 spaces are inserted instead, as if just two spaces had been typed.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `tabruler.doubleTapTime`: Time in milliseconds to detect double-tap of the space key.

## Known Issues

No known issues.

## Release Notes

Release notes:

### 1.0.0
